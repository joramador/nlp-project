<SECTION-HEADER> SHORT TITLE.	 This Act may be cited as the "National Cancer Act of 2003" . <SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS.	 Congress makes the following findings: In 2003, an estimated 1,334,100 Americans will be diagnosed with some form of cancer. In 2003, an estimated 556,500 Americans will die of cancer. In the United States, 1 in every 4 deaths results from cancer. In 2002, the National Institutes of Health estimated the overall cost of cancer at $171,600,000,000. In 2003, an estimated 211,300 American women and 1,300 men will be diagnosed with breast cancer, and 40,200 will die of the disease. A mammogram every 1-2 years can reduce the risk of dying by about 16 percent for women 40 years of age and older. In 2003, an estimated 40,100 women will be newly diagnosed with cancer of the uterine corpus and 6,800 women will die of the disease. In 2003, an estimated 147,500 Americans will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer and 57,100 will die of the disease. Incidence rates of colorectal cancer stabilized between 1995 and 1999. Research suggests that declines may be in part due to increased screening and polyp removal. The Chronic Disease Prevention Department found that screening for colorectal cancer can reduce the number of deaths by at least 30 percent. Regular screening examinations by a health care professional can result in early detection of cancers of the breast, colon, rectum, prostate, testis, oral cavity, and skin. If all these cancers were diagnosed at a localized stage through regular examinations, the 5-year survival rate would increase from 82 percent to 95 percent. Cancers of the lung, mouth, larynx, bladder, kidney, cervix, esophagus, and pancreas are related to tobacco use. The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2003 more than 180,000 cancer deaths will be caused by tobacco use. Smoking alone causes 13 of all cancer deaths. More than 1,000,000 skin cancers expected to be diagnosed in 2003 could have been prevented by protection from the sun's rays. An estimated 9,000 new cases of childhood cancer are expected to occur in 2003. Cancer is the chief cause of death by disease in children between the ages of 1 and 14. The American Cancer Society estimates that approximately 13 of the 556,500 cancer deaths expected in 2003 will be related to nutrition, physical inactivity, obesity, and other lifestyle factors that could be prevented. About 77 percent of all cancers are diagnosed at age 55 and older. In order to ensure high quality cancer care for American seniors, medicare reimbursements must reflect the true cost of treatment in every treatment setting and medicare payments should accurately reflect the cost of drug and biologics as well as the cost of administering drugs and supportive care therapies. Despite an aging population, death rates for the most common cancers, lung, colorectal, breast, and prostate continue to drop at an average of 1.7 percent per year. In May 2001, Gleevec, the first in what is expected to be a number of cancer treatments, was approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration as it appeared to be effective in stopping the growth of deadly Chronic Myeloid Leukemia cells within 3 months of use. In 2002, Gleevec showed ability to stop growth of gastrointestinal stromal tumors. In early 2003, researchers used gene chips to accurately predict whether or not breast cancer tumors would spread in the future. If the findings are validated, doctors will be able to determine which patients are likely to relapse and need chemotherapy, while sparing those with a favorable prognosis from additional treatment. The Lance Armstrong Foundation, a leading national organization providing services and support for cancer survivors, defines cancer survivorship as living with, through, and beyond cancer. In 2001, there were 9,600,000 cancer survivors in the United States. Sixty percent of adults diagnosed with cancer survive at least 5 years. While nearly every childhood cancer diagnosis 20 years ago was fatal, today more than 80 percent of children diagnosed with cancer survive at least 5 years . <SECTION-HEADER> SENSE OF THE SENATE.	 It is the sense of the Senate that the United States is at a point in history in which we must take the proper steps to reach the goal of making cancer survivorship the rule and cancer deaths rare by the year 2015.

<SECTION-HEADER> SHORT TITLE.	 This Act may be cited as the "Troop Talent Act of 2013" . <SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS.	 Congress makes the following findings: According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate for recent veterans of military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan was 9.4 percent in February 2013, compared with 7.6 percent in February 2012. With the unemployment rate among such veterans higher than the national average and the number of veterans receiving unemployment benefits doubling since 2002, there is a significant need to assist members of the Armed Forces as they transition to the civilian workforce. In order to remain competitive in the civilian employment market, members of the Armed Forces and veterans require information about how their military skill sets translate to the requirements of the civilian workforce. Members of the Armed Forces currently receive insufficient or inadequate information during their training for military occupational specialties on translating skills obtained during such training to civilian occupations and credentials. In addition, there is a need for enhanced access by accredited credentialing agencies to military training curricula in order to facilitate and enhance the correlation between military training and applicable civilian credentialing courses and exams. The information technology sector is one of the fastest growing industries, with tremendous job growth and demand for talented, qualified individuals. The information technology sector has an unemployment rate of 3.5 percent according to a Bureau of Labor Statistics report from February 2013. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a need for 110,000 computer support specialists over the next decade. Currently, the size of the information technology workforce in the Armed Forces is about 160,000 members . <SECTION-HEADER> ENHANCEMENT OF MECHANISMS TO CORRELATE SKILLS AND TRAINING FOR MILITARY OCCUPATIONAL SPECIALTIES WITH SKILLS AND TRAINING REQUIRED FOR CIVILIAN CERTIFICATIONS AND LICENSES.

<SECTION-HEADER> SHORT TITLE.	 This Act may be cited as the "Taxpayer's Right To View Act of 1993" . <SECTION-HEADER> FINDINGS.	 The Congress finds the following: The Federal Communications Commission predicts a diminished role for broadcast television and a more prominent role for cable television including pay-per-view. Roughly 18,800,000 American homes are equipped to receive pay-per-view and this number is expected to increase to 35,900,000 by 1996. Overall pay-per-view revenue is expected to reach $1,100,000,000 by 1996. There is a growing trend toward making events available exclusively on pay-per-view. As this trend develops, whether the consumer has access to these events will be determined by the ability of the consumer to pay. Professional sports leagues are beginning to see pay- per-view as a new revenue source to keep pace with escalating player salaries. As a result, some media analysts predict that several of broadcast television's premier sports attractions eventually will migrate to pay-per-view. Limited access to viewing such events as the "Super Bowl" or "World Series" would deprive citizens of the ability to enjoy these events which are inherent in the American tradition. The majority of facilities in which such events are held are funded through taxpayer money. It is unfair that taxpayers, who subsidize the construction and maintenance of many of these facilities, should have to pay an additional pay-per-view charge for viewing these events. Nonprofit and public organizations including public and private educational institutions and their athletic organizations are exempt from the corporate income tax. Furthermore, corporations can deduct their donations to college sporting events as charitable contributions. Tax exempt status is granted to these nonprofit and public organizations by the Federal Government and it is unfair to allow those who use this status to engage in pay-per-view telecasting thus forcing taxpayers to pay again. It is unfair that taxpayers, who subsidize the construction and maintenance of many of these facilities, should have to pay an additional pay-per-view charge for viewing these events. Therefore, Congress should ensure that all taxpaying citizens have free access to events that are sponsored by organizations with nonprofit tax exempt status and those events held in taxpayer subsidized facilities . <SECTION-HEADER> PAY-PER-VIEW CHARGES PROHIBITED.	 Section 623 of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended by adding at the end thereof the following new subsection: (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, a cable operator may not assess or collect any separate charges for any video programming of a sporting, theatrical, or other entertainment event if that event is performed at a facility constructed, renovated, or maintained with tax revenues or by an organization that receives public financial support. The Commission and local franchising authorities are authorized to make determinations concerning the applicability of the prohibition contained in paragraph (1). In making such determinations a facility shall be considered to have been constructed, maintained, or renovated with tax revenues if tax exempt financing was used to construct, maintain, or renovate the facility, the facility was constructed on land donated by a government, or leased by a government at below market rates, or public infrastructure or public service for the facility are provided by the government at below market rates, with the exception of police, fire, and rescue services. An event is performed by a nonprofit or public organization that receives tax subsidies if the event is sponsored by, or includes the participation of a team that is a part of, an organization that is exempt from Federal income taxes under section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or that is exempt from Federal income taxes under section 115 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and to which donations are tax deductible under such Code. And notwithstanding subparagraph (A), a facility shall not be considered to have been constructed with tax revenues if the government has been reimbursed, through the proceeds of a sale of the facility or otherwise, for the total amount of the tax revenues that were used to construct the facility, as determined under subparagraph (A), but in this section shall be construed to exempt facilities from this subsection if the facility is receiving current financial support. The Commission shall prescribe, by regulation, procedures for the administration of this subsection.".
